                    Hi, my name is Antonio Angotti. I am 26 years old.
                    My hobbies consist of playing soccer and playing video games.
                    I am currently in a C# .NET Coding Bootcamp at Grand Circus Detroit.

                    I like to talk a lot and make people comfortable around me. I enjoy making people laugh.
                    I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up (haha), but I'm hoping after this Bootcamp
                    that I am a successful developer in the making.
                </p>

                    My dream is to be married happily with kids in the future
                    and to be able to be good enough at coding that I am able to make good money
                    while working remote from home.
                </p>
